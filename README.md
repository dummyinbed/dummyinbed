Heiii I'm probably gonna be offline alot more and I doubt alot of people are even going to see this. No, I most likely wont be responding to any messages because I keep going through stages of isolating myself or wanting to distance myself from literally everybody, I am in a weirdly negative part of my life lately and I keep going in deep stages because of Adderall crashes, easily getting irritated, and possible depression.
No, I would not like to talk about it, I have a VERY hard time opening up as much as I crave to. To the point where I don't even talk to my therapist about what happens -- But I do appreciate knowing that people are there/here for me. 😅

I know I sound like a horrible person to hang out with right now and I REALLY dont want to make anybody feel like they're walking on eggshells around me but I promise when I interact with anybody I act like I am perfectly fine so its really no difference other than my very long lack of response or wanting conversations. SORRY YALL.. I LOVE ALL OF YOU OOMFS ANED OTHERS,
